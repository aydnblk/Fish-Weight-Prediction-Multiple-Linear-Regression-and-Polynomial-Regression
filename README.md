# Fish-Weight-Prediction-Multiple-Linear-Regression-and-Polynomial-Regression

* This dataset is a record of 7 common different fish species in fish market sales. With this dataset, a predictive model can be performed using machine friendly data and the weight of fish can be predicted.

* I used linear regression and polynomial regression models to predict the weight of the fish according to given continuous variables and compared these two models through R-Squared(Coefficient of Determination) and MSE(Mean Squared Error) values and data visualization.

# Required Libraries

* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Sklearn
